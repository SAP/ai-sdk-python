# SAP Cloud SDK for AI (Python) - generative

The SDK formerly known as *generative AI Hub SDK* was rebranded.

With this SDK you can leverage the power of generative models available in the generative AI Hub of SAP AI Core.
This SDK provides LLM access by wrapping the native SDKs of the model providers (OpenAI, Amazon, Google), 
through langchain, or through the orchestration service.

## Installation

Use the package name to install the SDK with support for all models (OpenAI, Amazon, Google) 
including langchain support:

```bash
pip install "sap-ai-sdk-gen[all]"
```

With the name rebranding, class names have **not** changed i.e., you can continue to use existing code.

The default installation only includes OpenAI models (with langchain support):

```bash
pip install sap-ai-sdk-gen
```

You can install a subset of the extra libraries (with langchain support) by specifying them in square brackets:

```bash
pip install "sap-ai-sdk-gen[google, amazon]"
```

In the table below, you can see which models and vendor specific langchain packages are installed when using different installation parameters.

| Install Parameter                   | OpenAI | Google | AWS | LangChain | OpenAI-LangChain | Google-LangChain | AWS-LangChain |
|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----|-----------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
|                                     | yes    | no     | no  | yes       | yes              | no               | no            |
| [google]                            | yes    | yes    | no  | yes       | yes              | yes              | no            |
| [amazon]                            | yes    | no     | yes | yes       | yes              | no               | yes           |
| [amazon, google] / [google, amazon] | yes    | yes    | yes | yes       | yes              | yes              | yes           |
| [all]                               | yes    | yes    | yes | yes       | yes              | yes              | yes           |

## Configuration

There are different ways to configure the SAP AI Core access (listed in order of precedence):

- from AICORE_SERVICE_KEY environment variable, if it exists
- environment variables
- (profile) configuration file
- from VCAP_SERVICES environment variable, if it exists

These methods automatically initialize an authenticated client.
For custom authentication, you can provide a `proxy_client` parameter when instantiating SDK classes to use your own
`GenAIHubProxyClient` with direct credential configuration.

We recommend setting these values as environment variables or via config file. The default path for the configuration file
is  `~/.aicore/config.json`

### Environment variables

- `AICORE_CLIENT_ID`: This represents the client ID.
- `AICORE_CLIENT_SECRET`: This stands for the client secret.
- `AICORE_AUTH_URL`: This is the URL used to retrieve a token using the client ID and secret.
- `AICORE_BASE_URL`: This is the URL of the service (with suffix /v2).
- `AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP`: This represents the resource group that should be used.
- `AI_CLIENT_TYPE` (optional): Specify client type in request headers. Default is 'GenAI Hub SDK (Python)'. Note: This cannot be set in the config file.

For using X.509 credentials, you can set the file paths to certificate and key files, or certificate and key strings, 
as an alternative to client secret.

- `AICORE_CERT_FILE_PATH`: This is the path to the file which holds the X.509 certificate
- `AICORE_KEY_FILE_PATH`: This is the path to the file which holds the X.509 key
- `AICORE_CERT_STR`: This is the content of the X.509 certificate as a string
- `AICORE_KEY_STR`: This is the content of the X.509 key as a string

### AICORE_SERVICE_KEY environment variable

If you have an SAP AI Core service key (downloaded from BTP), you can pass it as a single environment variable instead of setting each credential separately. The SDK extracts `clientid`, `clientsecret`, `url`, and `AI_API_URL` from it automatically. You still need to set `AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP` separately, as the resource group is not part of the service key.

```bash
export AICORE_SERVICE_KEY='{
  "serviceurls": {
    "AI_API_URL": "https://api.ai.* * *.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
  },
  "clientid": "* * * ",
  "clientsecret": "* * * ",
  "url": "https://* * * .authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com"
}'
export AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP="default"
```

### Configuration files

By default, the configuration file is located at `~/.aicore/config.json`. You can change the directory where the config file is located by setting the `AICORE_HOME` environment variable.

Note: tilde (~) is not supported, so use the full path to the directory.

A profile is a json file residing in a config directory. With profile names one can switch easily between profiles e.g., for different (sub)accounts. The profile name can be passed also as a keyword. If no profile is specified, the default profile is used. Specify the profile via envionment variable `AICORE_PROFILE`. The associated configuration file then needs to have file name `config_{profile}.json`

The command `aicore configure --help` can be used to generate a profile.

The following list explains which environment variables can be used to control which configuration file will be used:

1. **`AICORE_HOME`**: This variable represents a directory path. Within this directory, various configuration files can be stored and the SDK will automatically load them from there based on the "AICORE_PROFILE" environment variable.

2. **`AICORE_PROFILE`**: This variable allows users to switch between different configurations stored in the `AICORE_HOME` directory. It is important to note that `AICORE_PROFILE` does not represent the complete name of a configuration file. Instead, it refers to a profile name, which corresponds to a file named `config_{profile}.json`.  If AICORE_PROFILE is empty `$AICORE_HOME/config.json` is used.

3. **`AICORE_CONFIG`**: This variable overrides both `AICORE_HOME` and `AICORE_PROFILE`. It specifies the direct absolute path to a configuration file that will be used.

The configuration file should be:

```json
{
  "AICORE_AUTH_URL": "https://* * * .authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com/oauth/token",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_ID": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_SECRET": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_BASE_URL": "https://api.ai.* * *.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/v2"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "AICORE_SERVICE_KEY": "{\"serviceurls\":{\"AI_API_URL\":\"https://api.ai.***.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com\"},\"clientid\":\"***\",\"clientsecret\":\"***\",\"url\":\"https://***.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com\"}",
  "AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP": "***"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "AICORE_AUTH_URL": "https://* * * .authentication.cert.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_ID": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_CERT_FILE_PATH": "* * */cert.pem",
  "AICORE_KEY_FILE_PATH": "* * */key.pem",
  "AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_BASE_URL": "https://api.ai.* * *.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/v2"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "AICORE_AUTH_URL": "https://* * * .authentication.cert.sap.hana.ondemand.com",
  "AICORE_CLIENT_ID": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_CERT_STR": "* * *",
  "AICORE_KEY_STR": "* * *",
  "AICORE_RESOURCE_GROUP": "* * * ",
  "AICORE_BASE_URL": "https://api.ai.* * *.cfapps.sap.hana.ondemand.com/v2"
}
```

## Usage

### Prerequisite

For direct model access, you need to create a deployment for each desired model according to according to
the [help documentation for model deployments](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-generative-ai-model-in-sap-ai-core).

For model access through the orchestration service, you need to create a deployment of the orchestration service according to the [help documentation for orchestration service deployments](https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-ai-core/sap-ai-core-service-guide/create-deployment-for-orchestration)

### Examples

In section "*Examples*" there are code snippets for each Large Language and Embedding model as well as for the orchestration service usage.

## Supported Models

The list of models in the Generative AI Hub of SAP AI Core can be found in [SAP note 343776](https://me.sap.com/notes/3437766).
