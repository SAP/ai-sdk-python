# SAP Cloud SDK for AI (Python) - generative

The SDK formerly known as *generative AI Hub SDK* was rebranded.
With this SDK you can leverage the power of Large Language Models available in SAP's Generative AI Hub.

## Installing and Using the SDK

Use the new package name to install the SDK:

```bash
pip install sap-ai-sdk-gen[all]
```

The class names have not changed i.e., you can continue to use existing code.

> [!NOTE]  
> Please refer to the [Generative AI Hub SDK Documentation](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk)

### For SAP Internal Teams

For internal SAP teams, the latest version of the SDK is available in our private artifactory. You will need to modify your pip.conf file to point to our internal repository. Here's how your pip.conf should look like :

```conf
[global]
index-url = https://int.repositories.cloud.sap/artifactory/api/pypi/build-snapshots-pypi/simple
trusted-host = int.repositories.cloud.sap
```

This will ensure pip looks for packages in the SAP internal repository.

After setting up the pip.conf file, you can install the SDK using the same pip command mentioned in the documentation.

## Development

The main modules are located in the subfolder [proxy](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk/tree/main/gen_ai_hub/proxy):

- [gen_ai_hub_proxy](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk/tree/main/gen_ai_hub/proxy/gen_ai_hub_proxy)
- [langchain](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk/tree/main/gen_ai_hub/proxy/langchain)
- [native](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk/tree/main/gen_ai_hub/proxy/native)

### Docstring Convention
In this project, we use the `reStructuredText` format for all Python docstrings, following the guidelines outlined in [PEP 257](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) and the [Sphinx documentation style guide](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html).
This ensures consistency and compatibility with other SDKs in the same namespace.

Please follow these conventions when contributing to the codebase.

## Renovate Setup

Renovate is set up for this repository. For further information, take a look at the [documentation in ml-api-facade](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/AI/ml-api-facade/blob/master/docs/renovate.md).

## Integration Tests

This project utilizes integration tests to verify the system’s behavior across its various components. The tests are split into two primary groups:

1. **Main Integration Tests:** Most of the integration tests are executed against the main cluster, ensuring that the major functionalities and interactions in the system behave as expected.

2. **Bedrock Integration Tests:** A targeted subset of integration tests, known as the Bedrock tests, are executed in a separate cluster US10 (prod). These tests focus specifically on the Bedrock portions of the system and are annotated with `@pytest.mark.bedrock` within the test classes. This separation allows for targeted testing of Bedrock-specific features without interference from the broader system functionalities.

### Running Bedrock Tests

To facilitate the execution of the Bedrock integration tests, the `Makefile` includes the command `run-acceptance-test-us10`. This command specifically triggers the execution of the Bedrock tests, enabling the CI system to verify the Bedrock integrations in isolation (separate step).

The mechanism of splitting the tests into distinct clusters and utilizing specialized commands for targeted testing helps in achieving more organized, efficient, and effective testing processes.

Additional details regarding custom test stages and configuration specific to the cumulus can be found in the `customTestStages` section of the `config.yaml` in the `.pipeline` folder.

## Documentation

### Overview

Our project includes an extensive internal documentation to assist developers and users in understanding the architecture, usage, and development of the project. The documentation is built automatically via our continuous integration workflows using [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/), a robust documentation framework that converts [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html) files into various output formats.

### Building Documentation Locally

If you wish to build the documentation on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the docs/ directory of the project.
2. Make sure you have Sphinx installed. If not, install it using `pip install sphinx` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Build the documentation by running `make preview_html`. This command will generate HTML output for the documentation and allow you to preview it in a web browser.

### Automated Documentation Builds with GitHub Actions

Our project leverages GitHub Actions to automate the documentation building process. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/documentation.yml`. It is triggered each time a pull request (PR) is merged into the `main` branch. Here's a rough sequence of the automated process:

1. GitHub Actions selects several important files within the project required for generating the documentation.
2. Using the Sphinx framework, GitHub Actions compiles these files into HTML format.
3. Upon successful build, the compiled documentation is pushed to the `gh-pages` branch of the repository.

### Documentation Location

Once the documentation is built by GitHub Actions, it is hosted and available for viewing at the GitHub Pages site. You can access the latest version of the internal documentation at the following URL:

[SAP Cloud SDK for AI (Python) - generative](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/AI/generative-ai-hub-sdk/)

Note that the content on this site reflects the most recent documentation build from the `gh-pages` branch.
